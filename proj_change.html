                                            <p><i>Background</i></p>
                                            <p>Years ago, I worked in a call center. My schedule, like others in my department, was dynamic, and our shifts changed on a consistent basis. We could be on the phones just as dawn broke out, or into the middle of the night, or any time in between. Scheduling long-term appointments was challenging, and maintaining a work-life balance even more so. A number of my coworkers were mothers of young children, and sometimes I overheard them having to reschedule an appointment, or I saw them leaving work early because of something urgent involving their children. I wanted to do something to help them out, but at that time I hadn’t even heard of UX design.</p>
                                            <p>When my project team first met and opened the floor to suggestions, immediately I proposed the idea that had been brewing in my mind since those days: to make a calendar app for people with changing work schedules. My idea was accepted and I took on the exclusive responsibility of designing a user-centered product.

                                        <h3>Phase 1: User Research</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    To conduct my research, I reached out to my network and soon interviewed real working parents (or homemakers who were raising children, such as time and available participants would allow). From their feedback, I identified commonalities using affinity diagramming and humanized the data via empathy maps and user scenarios.
                                                </p>
                                                <div class="insert">

                                                    <img class="insertImage" src="images\Copy of affinityDiagram_step4.png">
                                                </div>
                                                <p>
                                                    Interview questions were based on the research objectives: to understand the average working parent’s thought process during a sudden change in schedule, and to empathize with how they felt about their responses.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    After the interviews, the key takeaway I found was that working parents wanted a customizable calendar app, able to integrate with other apps, that could make it easy for them to track events.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    To add a point of focus for my user-centered design, I invented Lisa Hernandez, a composite persona of the data from my interviews. In her early 30s, Lisa was a working mother of two who wanted to adapt well to schedule changes and avoid the stress of being unprepared. Therefore, she was just right for the app I was envisioning.

                                        <h3>Phase 2: Definition</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar seemed the likeliest competitors regarding calendar functions, while Zapier offered a workflow creation and app integration solution, and ClickUp offered a task management service that would be useful in tracking things like calendar events.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Both calendar apps were easy to use and allowed for wide app integration and collaboration, but were limited in scheduling and automation features, at least in respect to resolving our user’s problem. Zapier excelled in app integration and automation; however, it was too technical for the average working parent, and suffered from multiple usability challenges. ClickUp had a strong ability to let its users share and collaborate with others on a custom-made task, but the app was bloated with so many options for the user to choose that they could be overwhelmed. The challenge became designing one app that gathered together the best functions of three different kinds of apps without suffering from their combined drawbacks.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                One of the other big points taken from the user interviews was that parents already knew what needed to be done if their schedule suddenly changed, but when the time came to put those ideas into action, their execution was slow and sloppy. What was challenging them, and how could the app I was designing help Lisa, my user persona, to overcome those obstacles and respond better?  
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                After referring back to the data and imagining myself as Lisa reacting to her schedule being changed, the problem dawned on me: Lisa was human. In the event that she was working, and received a call that her child was sick and needed to be picked up from daycare, Lisa couldn’t inform her boss and call her spouse and travel to the daycare and all the other things that had to be done right then and there. Like the rest of us, Lisa could only finish tasks one by one; maybe having to approach each assignment in different ways; maybe having to do it all by herself. It was inefficient and ineffective. Knowing now the challenge that parents were facing, I began to ideate.

                                            <p>
                                                Again, I engaged in thought experiments, approaching Lisa’s problem from the perspective of the smartphone she carried. When her schedule suddenly changed, what could an app on a phone do to respond better than Lisa could? A smartphone could multitask quickly and perfectly; it could connect with faraway devices, sending or receiving information without physically being there; it could run complex tasks for a long time without emotional strain; and it could do all that again and again in exactly the same way. All it needed was a human to command it. Of course, a phone could not pick up a child from daycare. However, things like texting other parents and emailing her coworkers; those could be tasks taken up by a machine. Therefore, the first iteration of my solution was an app that used customized automation, app integration, and time management to free Lisa in a time of surprise from the small but necessary tasks, and let her focus on what was important to her.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Before putting pen to paper, I made a list of the important tasks I would need users to test, and included the major screens the users would have to interact with to complete those tasks. For each screen, I jotted down the UI elements necessary to make them function. Keeping in mind that the app was supposed to be most useful when emotions were high and time was of the essence, I made accessibility the priority in deciding which screen appeared where within the information architecture, as well as where exactly to place each UI component on those screens. The sketches themselves went through four iterations before a single tester laid eyes on them.

                                        <p>
                                            In the very first draft of the sketch, I made the Daily Calendar view the home screen, because I thought Lisa would want to see how her immediate schedule was affected by change. Building on that idea, three of the four tabs on the navigation bar were calendar-related to make it easier for the user to access them instead of pressing a fast-action button. However, since the Workflows screen would be where Lisa would trigger her response, it seemed the next logical place she would go, so its tab was rightmost on the bar and so easiest for her thumb to reach. On the Workflows main page, I separated workflows into Continuous-mode and Standby-mode types: As their names suggested, Continuous workflows were always running once they were activated, while Standby-mode workflows ran only once upon activation and then reset once they completed their tasks. I thought having both options available would give users like Lisa more power in situations I could not predict.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            However, after the first sketches were made, it occurred to me that my setup could be unintentionally solving the wrong challenge. Referring back to the findings from the user interviews, I came to the conclusion that Lisa could already guess how her schedule would change; her problem– my problem– was how she responded to it. So I iterated my sketches, demoting the calendar from being the homepage to being a primary page, and making a new home screen for responding to change. I divided the area of the screen above the fold into halves, with the bottom half being where Lisa would activate her workflows to respond to changes, and the top half being reserved for a Control, which is what I called the task management function that allowed Lisa to manage the results of her response. These sections were placed to be most accessible when they were most needed. I also altered the navbar so that the Controls had their own tab if Lisa needed to revisit one later. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The next version came because I decided to add more visual elements as well as move the Controls tab to the right side of the navbar, because I thought that during a schedule change, the Controls would really be the most important section of the app for Lisa, being where most of the post-activation data would gather, giving her the best chance to control the situation (hence the name).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Following that, I decided to make further major changes that required a fourth iteration. Most noticeably, I reduced the navbar from four tabs to three by eliminating the former Controls tab. Now renamed “Manager” to be more inviting yet still accurate as to its function, I realized a Managers tab would be redundant since the Manager sessions already appeared on the home screen. In addition, I removed the Continuous Workflow feature from the design to keep the app focused on helping Lisa in unpredictable moments when she was caught unawares. After all, workflows that were always running took some control away from Lisa by definition, which opposed the app’s purpose. Having made these last changes, I uploaded the screen images to the InVision software, rendering the set into a clickable prototype for remote testing. I used the same methods to find testers as I did to find participants for user interviews. I had the five testers each complete the same tasks using the InVision prototype, and collected their feedback.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Altogether, the testers’ opinions could be summarized as, “great idea, but too technical”. First, and much to my surprise, a number of participants didn’t know what a workflow was. I had unconsciously assumed they would understand because I knew it from my background in UX/UI and business. My signifiers also needed to be improved, as some of the terms I used in the app confused testers, especially as to what affordances were available in a Manager– and what a Manager was, to begin with. Multiple testers also observed the need for an onboarding process that educated the user about the app. On the other hand, the app’s concept was praised. The layout was described as straightforward with clear UI elements that allowed for smooth navigation. Therefore, it seemed that the usability of the app was adequate, and so once the content could be simplified to appeal to a mass audience, I could have a minimum viable design on my hands.

                                            Yet, the most enlightening and exciting moment for me during the testing was when a tester suggested a new feature for the app. They used a variety of parenting apps, and remarked that opening and using them became a physical hassle if they were holding a baby and had only one free hand. They suggested that the app should include a button where the user could activate the app without the inconvenience of fully opening it. I saw immediately that such a feature could be useful for all working parents, and incorporated it into the mid-fidelity wireframes. After all, at some point or another, a parent was going to have to hold their baby.

                                        <h3>Phase 5: Style Guide / Mid-Fi Prototyping</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            For the mid-fidelity wireframes, I used Figma components from Google’s Material Design system because it was a well-known standard of design. With the first iteration of the wireframes in grayscale, I colored the elements I wanted the user to interact with while journeying on their primary path, so as to be visual hints. I had come up with new words for several functions, renaming the Workflows as “AutoAssists” because their purpose was to assist the user automatically when called upon, and relabelling Managers as “Monitors”, hoping this would better describe their function. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Added to the design was a set of wireframes depicting the process of activating an AutoAssist from the lock screen just by tapping a button. In the second iteration of the wireframes, I wrote real content copy in the onboarding screens to better introduce the testers to the app, and settled on icons for the navigation tabs.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As a UX designer, I had to consider the impact my designs would have on other participating departments. After conferring with the team programmer over a draft of the clickable mid-fidelity prototype, I concluded that, to save the team resources, I would eliminate the calendar function from the app. While a calendar feature had been the central basis for the app initially, my work had really been focused on how the user responded to schedule changes. Once I realized that problem could still be resolved sufficiently with just creating, activating, and monitoring multi-step workflows, trimming the app seemed both reasonable and necessary.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This third iteration was the version shown to testers for the next round. However, after a user observed that young children playing around with their device might accidentally (or as a prank) activate an AutoAssist without their parent’s knowledge, I saw that a modification was needed urgently, before even the next test could commence. Whereas the Activate button had been exposed on the lock screen previously, I added two measures of security. First, the notification was altered so that the button was hidden and the user had to expand the notification to reveal it. Then, I redesigned the interaction so that the user had to hold down the button before the AutoAssist would run after a few moments’ delay. I was confident these changes would be enough to prevent unintentional interaction with the app. Yet, I was unable to conjure a method to prevent misuse by unauthorized users; not without sacrificing ease of use and ruining the feature.

                                        <div class="insert">
                                        <p class="insertText"><i>“[I’m] nervous that I don’t have anything like this set up”. - a tester</i></p>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>
                                            The feedback from the testing was very positive and demonstrated that overall improvement on the previous prototype had been successful. Testers expressed delight with the lock screen AutoAssist-activation feature, and, even with the new security measures, thought it more easy to use than opening up their device and going into the app. Criticisms were generally of a smaller nature, most notably concerning the visual design like graphics and cues, and no mention was made of the app needing a calendar feature. The next major step then was to define and apply styling for the upcoming mockup.
